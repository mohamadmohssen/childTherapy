                diagnostic tools that are based on research to evaluate speech,
                language, and communication disorders. It is our hope that we
                can provide guidance during the therapy process while ensuring
                progress is monitored. Our team consists of experienced speech

                are carefully constructed and designed with the highest possible
                standards of accuracy and reliability. If you are a parent, a
